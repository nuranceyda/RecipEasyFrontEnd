This GitHub contains the Front End of the RecipEasy Tool.

Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS

Frontend used Spoonacular API as a meal planner and food tracker to get and show information
about each recipe and ingerdient from nutrition, allergens, and more.
It used JQuery and Axios to mitigate the transition from Spoonacular to our webapp and used Express to connect to the backend.
JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with Bulma were used for styling and logic on the webapp.
Finally, Heroku was used to deploy the project.

What is RecipEasy?

Well, imagine this scenario: it’s been a busy week, and you haven’t had much time to meal prep or go grocery shopping. 
You don’t have enough money to afford UberEats for a third time this week.
But, you have a potpourri of leftover ingredients that you don’t know what to do with. 
Moreso, you don’t know what you can really make with those ingredients. 
RecipEasy will solve this problem by allowing users to easily find recipes with whatever ingredients that you have. 
We would like to empower YOU to be more effective and efficient home cooks!
